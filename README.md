# myFlix server-side REST API
 
### This project is my first back end project with Career Foundry. I created a databse of movie information that users are able to access. People can register as users, login, update their information, add and delete movies to their favorites list, and deregister.


## Some Tools Used:

#### Node
#### Express Framework
#### MongoDB & MongoDB Atlas
#### JWT Tokens
#### Postman
#### Heroku


## To learn about the API points and how to use them, please refer to documentation.html which lays out a table of each request, its corresponding url, and the request and response body formats. You can also see this here: https://cryptic-taiga-17986.herokuapp.com/documentation
