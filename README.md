# myFlix server-side REST API
 
### This project is my first back end project with Career Foundry. I created a databse of movie information that users are able to access. People can register as users, login, update their information, add and delete movies to their favorites list, and deregister.


## Some Tools Used:

#### Node
#### Express Framework
#### MongoDB & MongoDB Atlas
#### JWT Tokens
#### Postman
#### Heroku


## Things I learned and had fun with:

#### I got to use the terminal for the first time throughout the entire project.
#### I loved getting to (begin to) learn about how servers work, and seeing a glimpse of how data can be connected to applications.
#### I learned about password encoding when entering a password into the terminal, and saw more of how detailed a programmer must be with casing and syntax to ensure their code, internal & external databases, and hosts can all connect properly.


## To learn about the API points and how to use them, please refer to documentation.html which lays out a table of each request, its corresponding url, and the request and response body formats. Each endpoint function is located in index.js
